## PowerCo Customer Churn Analysis Repository

This repository is dedicated to analyzing the customer churn trends of PowerCo, a utility company. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their services with a company over a certain period. Understanding and mitigating churn is crucial for businesses like PowerCo to maintain a stable customer base and sustain growth.

### Overview
PowerCo serves as a case study for exploring various aspects of customer churn, including:

- **Data Collection:** Gathering relevant data sets pertaining to customer interactions, demographics, usage patterns, and churn instances.
  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and organizing the collected data to make it suitable for analysis. This may involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigating the data to identify patterns, correlations, and potential factors contributing to churn. Visualization techniques are employed to gain insights into customer behavior.
  
- **Model Development:** Building predictive models to forecast churn based on historical data. This involves selecting appropriate algorithms, training the models, and evaluating their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
