## PowerCo Customer Churn Analysis Repository

This repository is dedicated to analyzing the customer churn trends of PowerCo, a utility company. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their services with a company over a certain period. Understanding and mitigating churn is crucial for businesses like PowerCo to maintain a stable customer base and sustain growth.

### Overview
PowerCo serves as a case study for exploring various aspects of customer churn, including:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and organizing the provided data to make it suitable for analysis. This may involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigating the data to identify patterns, correlations, and potential factors contributing to churn. Visualization techniques are employed to gain insights into customer behavior.
  
- **Model Development:** Building predictive models to forecast churn based on historical data. This involves selecting appropriate algorithms, training the models, and evaluating their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Determining the key features that influence churn prediction. This helps in understanding the drivers behind customer attrition and devising strategies to retain valuable customers.
  
- **Recommendation and Action Planning:** Formulating actionable recommendations based on the analysis findings to reduce churn rates. These recommendations may involve targeted marketing campaigns, personalized offers, or service improvements.

### Repository Structure

The repository is structured into four distinct tasks, each contributing progressively towards the completion of the assignment.

#### Task 1: Problem Statement Analysis and Framing

In Task 1, the primary focus is on conducting an initial analysis of the problem statement. Participants are required to articulate their thought process and initial approach to tackling the problem. Additionally, they must frame the problem statement within the realm of data science, outlining its key components and objectives.

#### Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Task 2 centers around Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Participants are tasked with performing thorough EDA on the provided dataset to uncover patterns and insights. Furthermore, there are specific bonus milestones that participants can aim to achieve during this phase, enhancing the depth and quality of their analysis.

#### Task 3: Feature Engineering and Model Training

Task 3 encompasses feature engineering and model training. Participants are expected to engineer additional features that demonstrate predictive power in identifying customer churn. Subsequently, they are required to train a Random Forest Classifier model to predict customer churn. As a bonus, participants should explore the potential profitability of offering a 20% discount to customers at risk of churning.

#### Task 4: (Yet to be uploaded)

By structuring the repository in this manner, participants can systematically progress through each task, incrementally building upon their analysis and modeling efforts. 
  
### Usage
Researchers, data scientists, and business analysts can leverage this repository to gain insights into customer churn dynamics and develop strategies to mitigate churn effectively. By understanding the underlying factors driving churn, PowerCo can proactively address customer needs and enhance customer retention efforts.
