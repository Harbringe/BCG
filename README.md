# PowerCo Customer Churn Analysis Repository

This repository is dedicated to analyzing the customer churn trends of PowerCo, a utility company. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their services with a company over a certain period. Understanding and mitigating churn is crucial for businesses like PowerCo to maintain a stable customer base and sustain growth.

## Overview
PowerCo serves as a case study for exploring various aspects of customer churn, including:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and organizing the provided data to make it suitable for analysis. This may involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigating the data to identify patterns, correlations, and potential factors contributing to churn. Visualization techniques are employed to gain insights into customer behavior.
  
- **Model Development:** Building predictive models to forecast churn based on historical data. This involves selecting appropriate algorithms, training the models, and evaluating their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Determining the key features that influence churn prediction. This helps in understanding the drivers behind customer attrition and devising strategies to retain valuable customers.
  
- **Recommendation and Action Planning:** Formulating actionable recommendations based on the analysis findings to reduce churn rates. These recommendations may involve targeted marketing campaigns, personalized offers, or service improvements.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured into four distinct tasks, each contributing progressively towards the completion of the assignment.

### Task 1: Business Understanding and Hypothesis Framing:

[Task 1 Link](https://github.com/Harbringe/BCG/assets/99803292/75996e70-6a24-4d2a-8887-806a4e382904)

#### Background Information:

PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME
(Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power-liberalisation
of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in
the SME segment. They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of
churning SME customers.

A fair hypothesis is that price changes affect customer churn. Therefore, it is
helpful to know which customers are more (or less) likely to churn at their current
price, for which a good predictive model could be useful.

Moreover, for those customers that are at risk of churning, a discount might
incentivize them to stay with our client. The head of the SME division is considering
a 20% discount that is considered large enough to dissuade almost anyone from
churning (especially those for whom price is the primary concern).

The Associate Director (AD) held an initial team meeting to discuss various
hypotheses, including churn due to price sensitivity. After discussion with your
team, you have been asked to go deeper on the hypothesis that the churn is
driven by the customers’ price sensitivities.

Your AD wants an email with your thoughts on how the team should go about
testing this hypothesis.

The client plans to use the predictive model on the 1st working day of every month
to indicate to which customers the 20% discount should be offered.

#### Task Brief:

Your first task today is to understand what is going on with the client and to think
about how you would approach this problem and test the specific hypothesis.

You must formulate the hypothesis as a data science problem and lay out the
major steps needed to test this hypothesis. Communicate your thoughts and
findings in an email to your AD, focusing on the data that you would need from the
client and the analytical models you would use to test such a hypothesis.

We would suggest spending no more than one hour on this task.

Please note, there are multiple ways to approach the task and that the model
answer is just one way to do it.

**If you are stuck:**

1. Remember what the key factors are for a customer deciding to stay with or
switch providers

2. Think of data sources and fields that could be used to explore the
contribution of various factors to a customer’s possible action

3. Ideally, what would a data frame of your choice look like – what should
each column and row represent?

4. What kind of exploratory analyses on the relevant fields can give more
insights about the customer's churn behaviour?

**Estimated time for task completion: 1 hour depending on your learning style.**


### Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
  

[Task 2 Link](https://github.com/Harbringe/BCG/assets/99803292/dac90df4-3772-4a6d-855e-5ae94e8c9209)


**Background Information:**
The BCG project team thinks that building a churn model to understand whether price sensitivity is the largest driver of churn has potential. The client has sent over some data and the AD wants you to perform some exploratory data analysis.

**The data that was sent over includes:**

- **Historical customer data:** Customer data such as usage, sign up date, forecasted usage etc.
- **Historical pricing data:** variable and fixed pricing data etc.
- **Churn indicator:** whether each customer has churned or not

**Please submit analysis in a code script, notebook, or PDF format.**

**Task brief:**

**Sub-Task 1:**

Perform some exploratory data analysis. Look into the data types, data statistics,
specific parameters, and variable distributions. This first subtask is for you to gain
a holistic understanding of the dataset. You should spend around 1 hour on this.

**Sub-Task 2:**

Verify the hypothesis of price sensitivity being to some extent correlated with
churn. It is up to you to define price sensitivity and calculate it. You should spend
around 30 minutes on this.

**Sub-Task 3:**

Prepare a half-page summary or slide of key findings and add some suggestions
for data augmentation – which other sources of data should the client provide you
with and which open source datasets might be useful? You should spend 10-15
minutes on this.

For your final deliverable, please submit your analysis (in the form of a
jupyter notebook, code script or PDF) as well as your half-page summary
document.

Note: Use the 2 datasets within the additional resources for this task and if you’re
unsure on where to start with visualising data, use the accompanying links. Be sure
to also use the data description document to understand what the columns
represent. The task description document outlines the higher-level motivation of
the project. Finally, use the eda_starter.ipynb file to get started with some helper
functions and methods.

**If you are stuck:** Think about ways you can define price sensitivity. Make sure to
think of all possible ways and investigate them.

**Estimated time for task completion: 1.75 hours depending on your learning style.**

### Task 3: Feature Engineering and Model Training


[Task 3 Link](https://github.com/Harbringe/BCG/assets/99803292/382ed37e-cc16-45aa-b435-b720005d2552)


#### Background Information:

The team now has a good understanding of the data and feels confident to use
the data to further understand the business problem. The team now needs to
brainstorm and build out features to uncover signals in the data that could inform
the churn model.

Feature engineering is one of the keys to unlocking predictive insight through
mathematical modelling. Based on the data that is available and was cleaned,
identify what you think could be drivers of churn for our client and build those
features to later use in your model.

First focus on building on top of the feature that your colleague has already
investigated: “the difference between off-peak prices in December and January
the preceding year”. After this, if you have time, feel free to get creative with
making any other features that you feel are worthwhile.

Once you have a set of features, you must train a Random Forest classifier to
predict customer churn and evaluate the performance of the model with suitable
evaluation metrics. Be rigorous with your approach and give full justification for
any decisions made by yourself as the intern data scientist.
Recall that the hypotheses under consideration is that churn is driven by the
customers’ price sensitivities and that it would be possible to predict customers
likely to churn using a predictive model.

If you’re eager to go the extra mile for the client, when you have a trained
predictive model, remember to investigate the client’s proposed discounting
strategy, with the head of the SME division suggesting that offering customers at
high propensity to churn a 20% discount might be effective.

Build your models and test them while keeping in mind you would need data to
prove/disprove the hypotheses, as well as to test the effect of a 20% discount on
customers at high propensity to churn.

#### Task Brief:

**Sub-Task 1** 
Your colleague has done some work on engineering the features within the
cleaned dataset and has calculated a feature which seems to have predictive
power.

This feature is **“the difference between off-peak prices in December and January
the preceding year”.**

Run the cells in the notebook provided (named feature_engineering.ipynb) to
re-create this feature. then try to think of ways to improve the feature’s predictive
power and elaborate why you made those choices.

You should spend 1 - 1.5 hours on this. Be sure to make use of the
“feature_engineering.ipynb” notebook to get started with re-creating your
colleagues' features.

**Sub-Task 2**

Now that you have a dataset of cleaned and engineered features, it is time to
build a predictive model to see how well these features are able to predict a
customer churning. It is your task to train a Random Forest classifier and to
evaluate the results in an appropriate manner. We would also like you to
document the advantages and disadvantages of using a Random Forest for this
use case. It is up to you how to fulfil this task, but you may want to use the below
points to guide your work:

- Ensure you’re able to explain the performance of your model, where did the
model underperform?
- Why did you choose the evaluation metrics that you used? Please elaborate on
your choices.
- Document the advantages and disadvantages of using the Random Forest for
this use case.
- Do you think that the model performance is satisfactory? Give justification for
your answer.
- (Bonus) - Relate the model performance to the client's financial performance
with the introduction of the discount proposition. How much money could a client
save with the use of the model? What assumptions did you make to come to this
conclusion?

You should spend 1 - 1.5 hours on this. When it comes to model evaluation and the
explanation of your results, feel free to use the additional links.

**If you are stuck:**

**Sub-Task 1**
- Think of ways to evaluate a feature against a label.
- Think of ways to add new features which would complement the already existing
ones.
- Think of feature granularity.
- Remove unnecessary features.

**Sub-Task 2**
- Is this problem best represented as classification or regression?
- What kind of model performance do you think is appropriate?
- Most importantly how would you measure such a performance?
- How would you tie business metrics such as profits or savings to the model
performance?

**Estimated time for task completion: 2-3 hours depending on your learning style.**

#### Task 4: 


https://github.com/Harbringe/BCG/assets/99803292/96dc6c48-8a3f-4ec5-a26c-73548ab1346c


**Background Information:**

The client wants a quick update on the project progress.
The AD wants you to draft an abstract (executive summary) of your findings so far.

**Task Brief:**

Develop an abstract slide synthesizing all the findings from the project so far,
keeping in mind that this will be for the key stakeholders meeting which the Head
of the SME division, as well as other various stakeholders, will be attending.

**Note:** a steering committee meeting is a meeting where the BCG team presents
key findings and recommendations (and/or project progress) to key client
stakeholders.

Please use the template and submit your summary slide in PDF format.

A few things to think about for this abstract include:
● What is the most important number or metric to share with the client?
● What impact would the model have on the client’s bottom line?

**If you are stuck:**
● What do you think the client wants to hear? How much detail should you go
into, especially with the technical details of your work?

● Always test what you write with the “so what?” test, i.e. sharing a fact, even an
interesting one, only matters if the client can actually do something useful with it.
E.g. 60% of your customers are from City A is pointless, but customers in City A
should be prioritized for giving discount as they are among your most valuable
ones, if true, is an actionable finding

**Estimated time for task completion: 30 minutes depending on your learning
style.**
